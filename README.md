## Description
Click [HERE](https://burger-logging-app.herokuapp.com) for the deployed application    

An app that logs all of the burgers that a user wishes to eat in a list and the burgers that have been eaten in another.    
The user can add a new burger to the list of burgers to be devoured (eaten) by clicking the "Add Burger" button. When the user clicks the "Devour" button, the burger will be 'devoured' and moved from the list of burgers to be devoured to the list of burgers that have been devoured. This will log all of the burgers that have been devoured.
